Singly Linked List in Python
This project is a basic implementation of a singly linked list in Python using object-oriented programming. It demonstrates how to create and manage nodes with common operations like add, print, and delete.

=>Features
1. Add nodes to the end of the list
2. Print all elements in the list
3. Delete a node at a specific (1-based) position
4. Handles edge cases with simple error messages:
   <> Empty list deletion
   <> Invalid or out-of-range positions

->How It Works
Two classes are defined:
1. Node: Represents each element with data and a pointer to the next node.
2. LinkedList: Manages the list and supports key operations.
